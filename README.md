# Your Flask Website

Welcome to My Website! This is a web application built with Flask, a lightweight and powerful web framework for Python.
I have also customized a free HTML template, creating a simple database to the contact form, e-mail validator checker.

This is Dimension, a fun little one-pager with modal-ized "pages"
and a cool depth effect (click on a menu item to see what I mean). Simple, fully
responsive, and kitted out with all the usual pre-styled elements you'd expect.
Hope you enjoy it :)

All the images used are personal - shooting took place in Bulgaria.
